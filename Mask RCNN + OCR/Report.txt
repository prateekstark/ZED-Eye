Things Done till now:
	> Lane Detection working with Videos (Good)
	
	> Extracting frames of Camera to be fed into OCR
	
	> OCR working with photos
	
	> Object Detection done on videos....(Done with ZED as well)

Future work for making it submittable--
	
	> The output of Object Detection should be printed in file
	
	> Link frame_extractor with ZED and feed it to OCR
	
	> Lane Detection with Camera (Needs lab environmant, physical environment)


Main Problem :
	> The speed of frame analysis of object detection is slow. 

Probable Solution:
	> Either use the frame_extractor data to feed in Object Detection...
	
	> Use a high GPU system and making GPU on.
