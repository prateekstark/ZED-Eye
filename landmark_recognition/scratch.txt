>> Parser and coordinate checked and debugging done. Several errors are still present..!

>> My lab is going quite busy these days, that is why its taking a longer time. But I plan to check and debug the findCamera.cpp and pointCameraToMap.cpp today itself.

>> The full working state can be reached in a day or two max..

Sorry for the delay!

Update:
Checked and debugged the other two helper files as well.

What Remains:
>> Checking landmark_recognition.cpp and finally compiling all the files together
>> Preparing README.md


Update: Code compacted, done debugging.

What remains: exeperimental debugging, updating README.md
